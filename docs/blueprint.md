## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon Green (#39FF14) to create a modern, attention-grabbing interface, hinting at digital and technological themes.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to create a cinematic viewing experience.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements to complement the neon green and draw the user's eye to important sections.
- Font for body and headlines: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its clean and modern appearance, providing excellent readability and aligning with the sleek, digital aesthetic.
- Use minimalist icons with neon outlines. These icons represent genres, ratings, and other movie details to give a sharp visual appeal.
- Design the layout to ensure key movie info (posters, titles) stays consistent for different screen sizes. Cards should expand without shifting content.
- Apply smooth transitions using Framer Motion. Subtle animations that focus on scaling and fading provide users with feedback upon interaction without being intrusive.
